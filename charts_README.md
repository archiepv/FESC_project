FESC Redesign

I chose the simple line chart design because this is the first time i'm implementing it on my design. I don't want to over complicate things and over commit because
right now, 3 pages is a lot of work especially when adding media query. Another reason is because the data only has 2 categories; date and 
billion btu. It's a pretty straight forward analysis of energy production and electricity consumption. So keeping it simple will make it easy to read. I don't need to put more complex design because the website i'm designing already has enough colors and design elements.

I'm using the classic line chart. If i have more time later, i will try and improve it.

NOTE: the line on my chart is not showing on my page though. Is this a bug?
