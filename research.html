				<h1>Research Vision</h1>
				<p>The Florida Energy System Consortium (FESC) performs scholarly research and analysis of energy systems that contributes
					to a sustainable energy economy for Florida. In formulating a research plan for FESC, it became obvious that while most
					current university research was focused on specific energy components, a research gap existed from a systems perspective.
					It was believed that combining expertise at the State universities would position university researchers to address energy
					systems in a manner not possible at a single university. Building on this observation, our stated vision is to be a world
					leader in energy research enabled by a systems approach.
				</p>

				<p>The Florida Energy Systems Consortium research funding was designated for FAU, FIU, FSU, UCF, UF, and USF. The FESC Steering
					Committee set a collaborative university research agenda that focuses on those areas that can most impact the State of Florida.
					This agenda has an overarching strategic research direction of understanding Florida’s energy systems. By doing so, the Consortium
					provides meaningful analyses to guide the development of a State strategic energy plan, identify opportunities for improved
					efficiency, and assess the impact of proposed changes, all of which lead to more informed actions.
				</p>
