All media queries are done. I just need to update the google charts. I need to fix it as well, because the lines are still not showing.
I might try a different style for it.

-Added a few more .scss files

/scripts

/html
-Everything is set
-fixed some of my "class" names
-trimmed some of the information that FESC website had written
-Added the chart in it's own "section" tag
